- [ ] Variable declaration and memory mapping
- [ ] Data types (int, float, char, etc.)
- [ ] Syntax errors vs Logical errors
- [ ] Compilation process overview

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Unit 2: Arithmetic Expressions & Precedence**
- [ ] Use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- [ ] Understand precedence and associativity
- [ ] Practice compound expressions like `a + b * c - d / e`
- [ ] Use of `()` to change order

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Unit 3: Conditional Branching and Loops**

#### ðŸ”¸ Conditionals (3 lectures)
- [ ] `if`, `if-else`, `nested if-else`
- [ ] `switch-case` statements
- [ ] Relational and logical operators (`==`, `&&`, `||`, etc.)
- [ ] Practice: max of 2/3 numbers, even-odd checker

#### ðŸ”¸ Loops (3 lectures)
- [ ] `while`, `for`, and `do-while` loops
- [ ] Break and continue
- [ ] Use loops for summing numbers, pattern printing, etc.
- [ ] Practice writing logic for factorial, prime numbers, etc.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Unit 4: Arrays**

#### ðŸ”¸ 1D Arrays
- [ ] Declare, initialize, and access 1D arrays
- [ ] Sum of elements, max/min, linear search
- [ ] Array input/output using loops

#### ðŸ”¸ 2D Arrays
- [ ] Matrix input and output
- [ ] Basic matrix operations: add, transpose

#### ðŸ”¸ Character Arrays and Strings
- [ ] Declare and initialize strings
- [ ] Input strings using `scanf`, `gets`, `fgets`
- [ ] String manipulation using loops and built-in functions

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Unit 5: Basic Algorithms**

- [ ] Understand basic time complexity (Big-O intuition)

#### ðŸ”¸ Miscellaneous Algorithms
- [ ] Finding roots (e.g., solving quadratic equations)
- [ ] Simple order of complexity examples (without formal proof)

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Unit 6: Functions**

#### ðŸ”¸ Function Basics
- [ ] Function definition, declaration, and calling
- [ ] Using standard library functions (`printf`, `scanf`, `strlen`, etc.)

#### ðŸ”¸ Parameter Passing
- [ ] Call by value
- [ ] Call by reference using pointers

#### ðŸ”¸ Arrays and Pointers in Functions
- [ ] Pass 1D arrays to functions
- [ ] Modify values using pointers (reference)

#### ðŸ”¸ Practice
- [ ] Create function to compute sum, average
- [ ] Function to modify two numbers using call by reference
- [ ] Function to remove a character from string
- [ ] Function for searching in array using pointer

---

### ðŸ“˜ Bonus Practice Topics
These are commonly asked and great for reinforcing your understanding:
- [ ] Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- [ ] Using pointers with arrays and strings
- [ ] Writing your own `strlen`, `strcpy`, etc. using pointers
