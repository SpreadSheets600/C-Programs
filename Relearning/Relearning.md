|  ☐  | Basic Syntax & Compilation | **Hello World**                    | Set up GCC, compile your first C program, print output.                  |
|  ☐  | Input / Output             | **Simple Calculator**              | Use `scanf` and `printf` to read numbers and perform arithmetic.         |
|  ☐  | Variables & Conditionals   | **Days Converter**                 | Convert days → years, months, days; learn `%`, `/`, and branching logic. |
|  ☐  | Loops                      | **Multiplication Table Generator** | Practice `for` and `while` loops; reinforce iteration syntax.            |
|  ☐  | Strings                    | **String Reverser**                | Reverse a string manually using loops and character arrays.              |
|  ☐  | Functions                  | **Temperature Converter**          | Break logic into functions for clean, modular code.                      |
|  ☐  | Arrays                     | **Average Marks Calculator**       | Take input for multiple students, compute averages using arrays.         |
|  ☐  | Pointers (Basics)            | **Swap Function (with Pointers)**     | Understand passing by reference and pointer syntax.              |
|  ☐  | Pointer Arithmetic           | **Array Element Access via Pointers** | Traverse an array using only pointers, no indices.               |
|  ☐  | Dynamic Memory (malloc/free) | **Dynamic Array**                     | Simulate an expandable array (like Python lists).                |
|  ☐  | Multidimensional Arrays      | **Matrix Operations**                 | Implement addition & multiplication of matrices.                 |
|  ☐  | Sorting Algorithms           | **Sort & Search Library**             | Implement bubble, insertion, and selection sort + binary search. |
|  ☐  | Statistics on Arrays         | **Mean/Median/Mode Calculator**       | Practice looping, logic, and memory-safe calculations.           |
|  ☐  | Structs                | **Student Record System (in-memory)**  | Define `struct` for students and store multiple entries. |
|  ☐  | Nested Structs         | **Library Management (Book + Author)** | Use nested structs to store hierarchical data.           |
|  ☐  | File Handling (Basics) | **Simple Logger**                      | Open, write, and close files safely with error checks.   |
|  ☐  | File Reading / Writing | **Mini Address Book**                  | CRUD operations using file storage.                      |
|  ☐  | Command-Line Args      | **Word Counter CLI**                   | Pass filename via command-line and count words.          |
|  ☐  | Modular Programming    | **To-Do List CLI (split files)**       | Use headers and multiple `.c` files to organize code.    |
